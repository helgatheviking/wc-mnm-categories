# WooCommerce Mix and Match - Categories

### What's This?

Experimental mini-extension for [WooCommerce Mix and Match](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products//) that adds products as mix and match options by product category.

### Important

1. This is proof of concept and not officially supported in any way.
2. Will not be performant on categories with large numbers of products.

### Usage

In the "Mix and Match" tab of the Product Data metabox you will now see a "Use Product Category" input with 2 options.

1. "Use default" - meaning use the normal Mix and Match method of searching and selecting individual products by their product title.
2. "Use product categories for contents" - search for and select product categories. Mix and Match will then display all products in those categories as options for the Mix and M atch container product.
